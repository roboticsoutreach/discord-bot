A discord bot to gate the entry of a discord server on multiple passwords (each one giving a different role)

The use case is as follows:

-   Send different people/groups the same discord link, with a different password.
-   Each user is prompted for their password on entry. If they enter the correct password, they are given their appropriate role.

## Requirements

See requirements.txt

For development, see `script/requirements.txt`

# Discord server set-up instructions

-   Ensure the `@everyone` role cannot see any channels by default.
-   Create a role named `Participant` which can see the base channels (i.e. #general)
-   Create a role named `Unverified Crew` which can see the crew onboarding channel.
-   Create a role named `Crew`.
-   Create a new channel category called `welcome`, block all users from reading this category in its permissions.
-   Create channel categories called `Team Channels` and `Team Voice Channels`.
-   Create a channel named `#announcements`, block all users from sending messages in it.
-   Set a crew password using `/passwd tla:SRO new_password:`
-   Make sure that the SRbot role is at the top of the role list (it can only assign roles below its own)
-   Create teams using the `/team new` command.

And voil√†, any new users should automatically get their role assigned once they enter the correct password.

## Install instructions

1. Set up discord to the correct settings (see above)

4. `pip install .`
5. `python -m sr.discord_bot`
6. In the server settings, ensure the `/join` command can be used by `@everyone` but cannot be used by the `Verified` role
7. Ensure the `/passwd` commands can only be used by `Blueshirt`s
